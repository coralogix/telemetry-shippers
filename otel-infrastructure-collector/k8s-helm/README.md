### K8s

This Infrastructure collector provides:

- [Coralogix Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/coralogixexporter) - Coralogix exporter is preconfigured to enrich data using Kubernetes Attributes, which allows quick correlation of telemetry signals using consistent ApplicationName and SubsytemName fields.
- [Cluster Metrics Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/k8sclusterreceiver) - The Kubernetes Cluster receiver collects cluster-level metrics from the Kubernetes API server. Alternative to Kube State Metrics project.

### Required

Make sure you have at least these version of the following installed:

- Kubernetes 1.24+
- Helm 3.9+

- **Secret Key**

Follow the [private key docs](https://coralogix.com/docs/private-key/) tutorial to obtain your secret key tutorial to obtain your secret key.

OpenTelemetry Infrastructure Collector require a `secret` called `coralogix-keys` with the relevant `private key` under a secret key called `PRIVATE_KEY`, inside the `same namespace` that the chart is installed in.

```bash
kubectl create secret generic coralogix-keys \
  --from-literal=PRIVATE_KEY=<private-key>
```

The created secret should look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  PRIVATE_KEY: <encrypted-private-key>
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: coralogix-keys
  namespace: <the-release-namespace>
type: Opaque 
```

## Installation

First make sure to add our Helm charts repository to the local repos list with the following command:

```bash
helm repo add coralogix-charts-virtual https://cgx.jfrog.io/artifactory/coralogix-charts-virtual
```

In order to get the updated Helm charts from the added repository, please run:

```bash
helm repo update
```

Install the charts:

```bash
helm upgrade --install otel-infrastructure-collector coralogix-charts-virtual/otel-infrastructure-collector \
  -f values.yaml
```

If you'd like to provide your own overrides for array values such as `extraEnvs`, `extraVolumes` or `extraVolumeMounts`, please beware that Helm does not support merging arrays, but instead the arrays will be nulled out (see this [issue](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/3486) for more). In case you'd like to provide your own values for these arrays, make sure that you first **copy over any existing array values** from the provided `values.yaml` file.

# Infrastructure Monitoring

## Kubernetes Events

Kubernetes events provide a rich source of information. These objects can be used to monitor your application and cluster state, respond to failures, and perform diagnostics. The events are generated when the cluster’s resources — such as pods, deployments, or nodes — change state.

Whenever something happens inside your cluster, it produces an events object that provides visibility into your cluster. However, Kubernetes events don’t persist throughout your cluster life cycle, as there’s no mechanism for retention. They’re short-lived and only available for one hour after the event is generated.

With that in mind we're configuring an OpenTelemetry receiver to collect Kubernetes events and ship them to the `kube-events` subSystem so that you can leverage all the other features such as dashboard and alerting using Kubernetes events as the source of information.

On the OpenTelemetry config, you will find a new pipeline named `logs/kube-events`, which is used to collect, process, and export the Kubernetes events to Coralogix.

### Cleaning the data

By default, there's a transform processor named `transform/kube-events` which is removing some unneeded fields, but feel free to override this and add back some fields or even remove fields that are not needed at all on your specific use case.

### Filtering Events

On large-scale environments, you may have hundreds or even millions of events per hour, and maybe you don't need all of them, with that in mind you can leverage another OpenTelemetry processor to filter the events and don't send it to Coralogix, below you can find a config sample.

```yaml
processors:
      filter/kube-events:
        logs:
          log_record:
            - 'IsMatch(body["reason"], "(BackoffLimitExceeded|FailedScheduling|Unhealthy)") == true'
```

This configuration is filtering out any event that has the field `reason` with one of those values `BackoffLimitExceeded|FailedScheduling|Unhealthy`, for more information about the `filter` processor feel free to check the official documentation [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/filterprocessor).
