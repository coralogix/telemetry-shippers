# ECS - OpenTelemetry

The image configuration utilises the *otlp receiver* for both *HTTP (on 4318)* and *GRPC (on 4317)*. Data can be sent using either endpoint.

Our Coralogix exporter allows us to use enrichments such as dynamic `application` or `subsystem` name, which is defined using: `application_name_attributes` and `subsystem_name_attributes` respectively. See [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/coralogixexporter) for more information on the Coralogix Exporter.

This guide shows the process for deploying Open Telemetry to ECS to fascilitate the collection of logs, metrics and traces.

### Required

- [AWS credentials must be configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html)
- [ecs-cli](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-cli#installing)
- [aws-cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- Coralogix Otel ECS [cloudformation template](https://github.com/coralogix/cloudformation-coralogix-aws/blob/master/opentelemetry/ecs-ec2/README.md)

### ECS Cluster

If you already have an existing ECS Cluster you can skip this step.

**Deploy a new cluster:**

```sh
ecs-cli up --region <region> --keypair <your-key-pair> --cluster <cluster-name> --size <no. of instances> --capability-iam 
```

The `--keypair` flag is not mandetory, however, if not supplied you will not be able to connect to any of the instances in the cluster via SSH. You can create a key pair using the command below:

```sh
aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name MyKeyPair --query 'KeyMaterial' --output text > MyKeyPair.pem
```

The `ecs-cli up` command will levarage cloudformation to create an ECS Cluster. Default values will be used to create and configure a VPC and Subnets, however these values and more can be controlled from `ecs-cli` as well, see:

```sh
ecs-cli up --help
```

### ECS Task Definition & Service

Once we have an ECS Cluster in place, we need to deploy a Task Definition, which is used by ECS to create an ECS Service to run Open Telemetry.

A **Task Definition** is a template defining a container configuration and an **ECS Service** is a configuration item that defines and orchestrates how a task definition should be run.

Deploy the cloudformation template found [here](https://github.com/coralogix/cloudformation-corlaogix-aws/tree/main/opentelemetry/ecs-ec2), ensuring that all the necessary parameters are provided

Once the template is deployed successfully, you can verify if the container is running using:

```sh
ecs-cli ps --region <region> -c <cluster name>
```

### Open Telemetry Configuration

When deploying Open Telemetry in ECS, if you are using the standard Open Telemetry distribution, you will be required to create a custom image with your configuration files baked in. This is not ideal as it requires you to rebuild the image each time you want to make a change to the configuration.

You also have the option of utilising the [coralogixrepo/coralogix-otel-collector](https://hub.docker.com/r/coralogixrepo/coralogix-otel-collector/tags) image. This is a custom distribution based on the official Open Telemetry Contrib image. It includes our custom [ecsattributes processor](https://github.com/coralogix/cloudformation-coralogix-aws/blob/master/opentelemetry/ecs-ec2/components.md#the-ecsattributes-processor) and our [awsecscontainermetrics](https://github.com/coralogix/cloudformation-coralogix-aws/blob/master/opentelemetry/ecs-ec2/components.md#aws-ecs-container-metrics-daemonset-receiver) receiver for ECS, which allow for better attribute and label correlation when running Open Telemetry as a daemonset on ECS.

The image allows you to pass in your configuration files as a Base64 encoded environment variable. `OTEL_CONFIG`

This repo provides example of the following configuration files (you can create other configuration with combination for logs/metric/taces) which work directly with the *coralogixrepo/coralogix-otel-collector* docker image for ECS and the cloudformation template provided [here](https://github.com/coralogix/cloudformation-coralogix-aws/blob/master/opentelemetry/ecs-ec2/README.md).

- [logging](logging.yaml)
- [traces & metrics](config.yaml)

####Â About batch sizing

[Batch processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/processor/batchprocessor) ensures that the telemetry being sent to Coralogix backend is batched into bigger requests, ensuring lower networking overhead and better performance. The batching processor is enabled by default and we strongly recommend to use it. By default, the `otel-integration` chart uses the following recommended settings for batch processors in all collectors:
  
  ```yaml
      batch:
        send_batch_size: 1024
        send_batch_max_size: 2048
        timeout: "1s"
  ```

These settings imposes a hard limit of 2048 units (spans, metrics, logs) on the batch size, ensuring a balance between the recommended size of the batches and networking overhead. 

You may adjust these settings according to your needs, but when configuring the batch processor by yourself, it is important to be mindful of the size limites imposed by the Coraloigx endpoints (currently **max. 10 MB** after decompression - see [documentation](https://coralogix.com/docs/opentelemetry/#limits--quotas)). 

More information on how to configure the batch processor can be found [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/processor/batchprocessor#batch-processor).

### Deploying Open Telemetry

Once you have your configuration files and ECS Cluster ready, you can deploy Open Telemetry to ECS using the cloudformation templates available [here](https://github.com/coralogix/cloudformation-coralogix-aws/blob/master/opentelemetry/ecs-ec2/README.md).
