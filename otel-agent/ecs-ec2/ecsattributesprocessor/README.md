The coralogixrepo/otel-coralogix-ecs-ec2 docker image includes an Open Telemetry distribution with a dedicated processor designed to handle metadata enrichment for logs collected at the Host level. This processor enables the collector to discover metadata endpoints for all active containers on an instance, utilizing container IDs to indentify metadata endpoints to enrich logs and establish correlations. It's important to note that the default resourcedetection processor does not offer this specific functionality.

### Pre-requisites
- Privileged mode must be enabled for the container running the collector
- The `docker.sock` must be mounted to the container running the collector at `/var/run/docker.sock`
- This processor uses the container ID to identify the correct metadata endpoint for each container. The processor checks for the container ID in **resource** attribute(s) specified during configuration. If no container ID can be determined, no metadata will be added.

Only containers with a valid ECS metadata endpoint will have attributes assigned, all others will be ignored.

To verify your container has a valid ECS metadata endpoint, you can check for the following environment variables in the your running container:

- ECS_CONTAINER_METADATA_URI
- ECS_CONTAINER_METADATA_URI_V4

Atleast one must be present.

### Configuration

The ecsattributes processor is enabled by adding the keyword `ecsattributes` to the `processors` section of the configuration file. The processor can be configured using the following options:

| Config               | Description                                                                                                                                                                      |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| attributes           | A list of regex patterns that match specific or multiple attribute keys.                                                                                                         |
| container_id.sources | The **resource** attribute key that contains the container ID. Defaults to `container.id`. If multiple attribute keys are provided, the first none-empty value will be selected. |

Note, given a `log.file.name=<container.id>-json.log`, the `ecsattributesprocessor` will automatically remove the `-json.log` suffix from the container ID when correlating metadata.

The following config, will collect all the [default attributes](#attributes).

```yaml
processors:
  ecsattributes:

  # check for container id in the following attributes:
  container_id:
    sources:
      - "container.id"
      - "log.file.name"
```

You can specify which attributes should be collected by using the `attributes` option which represents a list of regex patterns that match specific or multiple attribute keys.

```yaml
processors:
  ecsattributes:
    attributes:
      - '^aws.ecs.*' # all attributes that start with ecs
      - '^docker.*' # all attributes that start with docker
      - '^image.*|^network.*' # all attributes that start with image or network
```

### Important

- The `ecsattributesprocessor` uses the Docker API to collect metadata for each container. It refreshes the metadata every 60 seconds as well as everytime a new container is detected via Docker events. If the processor is unable to collect metadata for a container or if there are errors during the refresh process, the processor will log the error and continue processing the next log record. **It will not halt/crash the open telemetry process**. If you notice metadata not being added to your logs, please check the logs for the collector for any errors related to the `ecsattributesprocessor`.

**TODO:**
- Implement a configuration option that allows the user to specify what action to take on error. For example, `continue` or `halt`.
